## Terraform Challenges

I wanted to create a place for folks that are looking to get into Terraform to have a book of challenges that 
they could try to code in Terraform for practice and mastery of the HCL.  These challenges are related to 
real life projects that the community has been a part of, not just made up.

### How to use the challenges

Fork the repo and pick the challenge that you're interested in attempting.  You'll find in every challenge 
a readme that explains the scenario and the terraform folder and files that you'll need to build in order 
to complete the challenge.

You can then create a new branch to test your solutions on.

### Important Note

Building these challenges may incur some costs, the author should provide an estimate of the costs on 
the challenge.  You are responsible for all costs associated with the terraform you deploy
