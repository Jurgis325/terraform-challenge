## Terraform Challenges Contributions

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Terraform Challenge page.  My hope is that we can grow the 
challenges so that folks that are new to terraform will continue to learn using real world projects.

You should start by taking a look at the [example](challenges/example/README.md) challenge and copy the 
approach from that challenge.  I would like all the challenges to be foldered and formatted the same.

In order to contribute, your challenge will need the following aspects:  

- Your challenge should be clear as to what the end result should be.  We aren't trying to trick our 
challengers in any way.
- You need to include the difficulty level in the challenge.  This will be an estimate of course and your 
difficulty level might be adjusted if many are finding it too hard or too easy.
- You should include a cost estimate so challengers know what the likely costs are if doing the challenge.
Further effort should be made to make the challenge fit into the free tier if possible.  No challenge should
cost more than $2 to complete.  
- You should provide a "challenge.tfvars" file that will guide the challenger in any variables that would
need to be chosen.  You should hard code sizing into your tfvars files to protect our challengers from 
overprovisioning resources.
- Remind your challengers to destroy their resources when completed.

### Challenge or Structure issues

If you notice any issues with the challenges or concerns about the structure overall, please raise an issue
or a PR to fix what you're wanting to adjust.
