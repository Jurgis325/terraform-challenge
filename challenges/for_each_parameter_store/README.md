### Destroy

Not 100% sure if I completed the objective here.  The request was for 10 parameters to be uploaded using the for_each syntax but was only given 6.  I added my own and ended up with 10 parameters using the for_each loop so...technically correct?

I wasn't sure if the each parameter needed a unique value but it seems the goal was to get familiar with the for_each code segment so I chose the easy way.
