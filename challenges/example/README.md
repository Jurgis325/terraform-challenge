## Challenge Name

This is the example challenge that can be used to create new challenges.  You'll name your challenge something
sensible.

### Scenario

This is where you'll explain the scenario that you need to be completed.  You'll list any constraints and 
limitations that should be considered during the build.

### End Goal

Here you'll explicitly define the end goal for the scenario.  It should be clear from the requirements what
the challenger needs to build.

### Estimated Difficulty

Here you'll list the difficulty using t-shirt sizing: Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard.

### Estimated Costs

Here you can estimate the costs building this in a sandbox using t-shirt sizing: Free, $ (less than $1), or $$
(less than $2).  No challenge should cost more than $2 to deploy.
